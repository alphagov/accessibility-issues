[Video of screen reader browsing a site when every title is read out as the same.]

<video controls="controls" src="sample.mp4"></video>

Pages on the same site have all the same page title.


## Why it's a problem

* The page title is often the very first thing a screen reader reads out. It helps screen reader users to know quickly which page they are on and what it is about. When pages have all the same generic page title, it will make orientation difficult.
* Users often use page titles to identify a page, for example because it will be what a search engine uses as the link text to the page or it appears in users' bookmarks. Generic page titles make those confusing.
